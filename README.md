# Valorant-Stats program

## Goal
Learn more about Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries. I'm using both libraries to extract informations of a website called tracker.gg/valorant

That's just for educational purposes and nothing more! 

## Libraries 
* BeautifulSoup - Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files
* Requests -  a simple, yet elegant HTTP library that allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. 


## Instalation of libraries

#### 1. Installing pip

Pip is the package installer for Python. On Linux, you can install through the terminal.

```
sudo apt install python3-pip

```

#### 2. Cloning my repository

```
git clone https://github.com/HicaroD/Valorant-Stats.git

```

#### 3. Installing the packages

First, go to the Valorant-Stats folder using ``` cd Valorant-Stats ``` and after that you can install the packages using ``` pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
